# Growth-Metab-MV-2025
This R project is used to take raw respirometry slopes measured on *Galaxias maculatus* at Deakin's Marine Research Centre in Queenscliff, Victoria, Australia and calculate their 
standard, routine, and maximum metabolic rate. These metabolic measurements are made repeatedly on known individuals held under one of two temperature treatments (18°C or 23°C), 
and paired with repeated mass and length measurements over five month of data collection (May - September, 2023). After reading in all data, a multivariate mixed effects modeling 
approach is undertaken in order to assess covariance between growth and metabolism traits among- and within-individuals.
